Welcome to the VEXLib Framework!  
This project brings together simulation tools, a really cool code push and log sync tool, comprehensive unit & integration testing, log visualization,
and lots of utilities to make VEX V5 robot development easier and more fun.

Docs are [here](https://deekb.github.io/VEXlib/)

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's a quick tour of what's included:

- **`src/`** — Core robot code: autonomous routines, drivetrain logic, odometry, and subsystem modules.
- **`sim/`** — Simulation tools like Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm and PID analysis tools.
- **`tests/`** — Unit tests to make sure everything works reliably.
- **`deploy/`** — Deployment-specific scripts and configurations.
- **`util/`** — Handy utilities: friction testers, serial communication tests, environment map encoders, and more.
- **`logs/`** — Recorded logs from drivetrain, scoring mechanisms, and other subsystems, automatically synced from the robot every
  time you push code!
- **`assets/`** — An extra folder including anything you want (SVG Logos and a render script by default) on the robot to display or use, pushed to the
  robot with the code.
- **`docs/`** — Generated documentation files and help pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting started with VEXLib and Pycharm, I HIGHLY recommend PyCharm for this project, it integrates very nicely, from the preconfigured run configurations to the in-IDE graph display. (You can even get the professional version for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students">free</a> if you are a student or a teacher)


1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deekb/VEXLib
cd VEXLib
```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Push the example code to the robot**

```shell
python3 -m deploy
```
you should see something similar to this, this is the deployment script running, by default it will look for a removable storage medium with the string `VEX` in the name and push code to that, for configuration edit `/deploy/config.ini`:
