This is a library I have been working on for a while, it has served as the main codebase for our robot during the 2024
season, but I hope to convert it to a fully-functional library to allow vex teams who are familiar with python or just
want a simple but functional interface to control aspects of their robot. I am a member of the FIRST community as well
and have taken inspiration from how the WPILIB framework works in how my code is structured.
