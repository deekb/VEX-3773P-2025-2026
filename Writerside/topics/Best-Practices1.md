# Unit Test Best Practices

## Edge Cases and Error Handling:

- Tests include edge cases (e.g., very small or large values, invalid inputs) to ensure robustness.
- Error scenarios are tested using `assertRaises` to verify proper exception handling.

## Mocking:

- Mock objects (e.g., `MagicMock`) are used to simulate hardware components like sensors (`Inertial`) or external dependencies.

## Assertions:

- Various assertions (`assertEqual`, `assertAlmostEqual`, `assertRaises`, etc.) are used to validate expected outcomes.
